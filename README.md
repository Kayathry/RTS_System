In today's world, security systems are crucial for many public and private sectors, including 
banking, finance, shopping malls, multi-story buildings, and home security systems. In today's 
world, video monitoring is critical for sustaining social security. Due to an increased sense of 
security brought on by technologies like CCTV and RFID, there has been a surge in video 
surveillance systems in both public and private settings in recent years. The picture is blurry, the 
structure is complex, the stability is poor, a lot of storage space is required to retain the 
monitoring information, and the costs are still relatively high. These are only a few of the flaws 
in video surveillance systems. This study suggests an Internet of Things-based real-time security 
surveillance system. Using a Raspberry Pi setup or through the IoT system, more 
surveillance area can be covered. The raspberry pi setup will automatically deliver video data 
streaming to the cloud server. Here C310 HD webcam camera module is used, which can be 
capable of 1280*720p high-definition video modes and still image. It can connect to a Raspberry 
Pi setup and send the record image to the registered email of the user after recorded video sent to 
the cloud server that is scene in the surveillance area.
